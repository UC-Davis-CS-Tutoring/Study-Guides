\chapter{Introduction to ECS 36B}
There are a number of overarching learning objectives for the ECS 36B class,
listed
\href{https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/ecs-36b-software-development-and-object-oriented-programming/}{on
the CS department's website}.  The four main ones are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Object-oriented programming in C++
    \item Basic data structures and their use
    \item Writing good programs of increased complexity and efficiency
    \item Methods for debugging and verification
\end{enumerate}

We will cover each of these concepts in separate chapters. Of the four, the
first (object-oriented programming in C++) is usually focused on the most
during the course, while the other three are often learned ``along the way"
through complex homework assignments.

As with all study guides, this is not meant to be a comprehensive review of the
material and should not be used as your only study materials. We aim to present
``just the highlights" of the course, which is hopefully helful for narrowing
down exactly what you need to spend more time studying.
