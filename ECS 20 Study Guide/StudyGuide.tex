\chapter*{How to Use This Study Guide}
This study guide is meant to help you review topics before the midterms and the
final. Please do not use this study guide as your main source of preparation
for exams. \\
\par This study guide goes over each and every topic in ECS 20. I have
previously taken ECS 20 with Professor Koehl, so I have a pretty good idea
about exams and the material covered. Hence this study guide is tailor made for
students in Professor Patrice Koehl's ECS 20. If you are not in Professor
Koehl's ECS 20 and still wish to use this study guide, please go ahead and do
so. Please be forewarned that some topics might not covered in this study guide
that other professors might cover (for example: Graph Theory is not covered in
this study guide). \\
\par Each chapter in the study guide reviews important concepts and theorems.
Furthermore, I have gone ahead and solved some questions that have been asked
on previous midterms. Additionally, I have added a few questions for you to try
out on your own (\textbf{No solutions have been provided}). \\
\par I sincerely hope that this study guide helps you better prepare for the
midterms and the final! Good luck on this challenging course. \\
