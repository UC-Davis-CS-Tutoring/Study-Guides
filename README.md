## Important Notes to the Reader

* These Study Guides are meant to help students _review and/or refresh topics_
before exams. Study guides are __NOT__ meant to be used as a primary means to
prepare for exams.

* These study guides may contain some topics which may not be covered by your
instructor during that particular quarter. If you notice a topic that is
missing from our study guide (but was covered in your class), contact us
at: `ucdcstutoring [at] gmail {dot} com`.

* Although, we are going to make these study guides independent from the course
material given to you by your instructor, the material covered in the study guide
will most certainly be inline with whatever is taught during the quarter
(After all, we've taken the same class at Davis and tutored for these classes
several times, so we know what's going to be there).
